# 3D_particle-based_fluid

We create a 3D fluid, imitating pouring liquid into a bottle. In order to make the result more interesting, we lean the bottle a little bit. We name the resulting animation “candy ocean”, as the liquid is formed by colorful particles.

How to run this program:

Download all the OpenGL Library we used in Assignment3.

Follow the exact set-up instructions we used in Assignment3.

The project is called "ParticleBasedFluid". (i.e. if you are using Visual Studio, you will find a "ParticleBasedFluid.sln" inside the build directory).

Run the code in Release Mode in order to obtain a smooth animation.

Press "R" or "r" from the keyboard to start a new generation.
